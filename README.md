# Data Hiding Using LSB Steganography  

This repository contains a MATLAB project that implements data hiding using the **Least Significant Bit (LSB)** steganography technique. The project allows embedding and extracting hidden text within images while preserving the visual quality of the steganographic media.  

## Features  
- **Input Image**: Accepts a cover image for the steganographic process.  
- **Input Text**: Allows users to input hidden data (e.g., "I'm not just a cat; I'm a data hacker").  
- **LSB Embedding**: Encodes the text data into the least significant bits of the image pixels.  
- **Text Extraction**: Recovers the hidden text from the steganographic image with precision.  

## Highlights  
- Utilizes the **LSB** technique for efficient and imperceptible data embedding.  
- Ensures minimal distortion of the original image quality.  
- Supports various image formats for flexibility.  

## How to Use  
1. Clone this repository and open the project in MATLAB.  
2. Run the script for LSB-based steganography.  
3. Provide an input image and the text data to hide.  
4. Save the resulting steganographic image.  
5. Use the extraction feature to retrieve the embedded text.  

## Tools & Techniques  
- **MATLAB**: To implement LSB steganography algorithms.  
- **Image Processing Toolbox**: Ensures seamless embedding and extraction.  
- **LSB Technique**: Modifies the least significant bits of image pixels for data hiding.  

This project demonstrates a simple yet effective steganographic approach, ideal for students and researchers exploring secure data communication techniques.
